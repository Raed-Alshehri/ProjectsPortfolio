# Covid-19 Data Visulaization

 This project is a continuation of the analysis of Covid-19 data performed using SQL in the [previous project](https://github.com/Raed-Alshehri/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/Covid19%20Data%20Exploration)
 
 After querying the data and answering important questions, I used Tableau to visualize the data into a more meaningful graphical representation.
