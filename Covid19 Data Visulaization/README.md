Raed Alshehri: Covid19 Data Visulaization


This project is a continuation of the analysis of Covid-19 data performed using SQL in the [previous project](https://github.com/Raed-Alshehri/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/Covid19%20Data%20Exploration)

After querying the data and answering important questions, I used Tableau to visualize the data into a more meaningful graphical representation.
I created a dashboard from excel tables, check it out [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid19DataVisulaization_16555541794010/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
