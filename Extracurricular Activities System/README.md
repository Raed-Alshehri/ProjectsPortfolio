# KFUPM Extracurricular Activities System

 This project is an information system created for my university King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM).
 
  All student clubs, events, non-academic lectures, volunteering activities are combined into a single system with a shared database.
  
   The system encourages students to register in clubs and events as well as ease the management of student clubs and Deanship of Student Affairs. 
## Project Main Deliverables

Upon starting the project, The Waterfall methodology was the most suitable methodology for this project.
- The work plan and the work breakdown structure (WBS) were created:

- Gantt Chart was also created for planning and scheduling the project:

- Then, a feasibility analysis was conducted to determine whether to proceed with the project

### The requirements of the system were investigated and found to be:


| Business Requirements  |  User requirements  | Functional requirements  |  Nonfunctional requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organize non-academic activities by grouping them in a single system  |  Register for extracurricular activities and student clubs |  Allow clubs, Student Success Center to create and schedule a new event | The system is web-based and accessible through KFUPM portal  |
|  Improve registration for student clubs and activities | Generate a report showing all attended events  |  Allow students to register in a student clubs and activities |  Interact and respond to the user within less than 5 seconds |
|  achieving continual communication with Student Success Center and Deanship of Student Affairs | View status of upcoming activities  |  Allow clubs and students to modify existing registration | Handle hundreds of registration activities simultaneously  |
| Encouraging students to register in non-academic activities with a fairly easy to use system  |  Schedule (meetings and activities) and send announcements | Allow Deanship of Student Affairs, clubs, Student Success Center to view a report of all conducted events  | Help users to fill in the mandatory fields automatically  |



## Use Case Analysis
The use cases were created to illustrate the activities that are performed by the users of the system.

## Data Flow Diagram
Data flow diagrams exhibit the business processes and the data that passes among each process.

## Demo and Prototype of the Web-Based System

Before creating a prototype for the system interface, an Interface Structure Diagram (ISD) was created.
The ISD shows all the screens, forms, and reports in the system, how they are related, and how the user moves from one to another.

A prototype of the website that will use the shared database was created using Wix:

## Database Design and Implementation

- After identifying the entities, the attributes, and the relationships between them, the database design started with the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![App Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raed-Alshehri/ProjectsPortfolio/main/Extracurricular%20Activities%20System/Images/ERD.jpg)

- To enhance the design, an Extended ERD was also created (EERD):

- After that, to ensure that there will be no redundant data, a database normailization was performed and a Functional Dependency Diagram is drawn below:

- Finally, the database was Implemented using SQL for easier querying and manipulation [here](https://github.com/Raed-Alshehri/ProjectsPortfolio/blob/main/Extracurricular%20Activities%20System/Extracurricular%20Activities%20Database.sql)
