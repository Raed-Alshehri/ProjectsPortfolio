# Driving License

 This project is a program written in Python that does the following:
 -	Stores the data of citizens who want to issue a driving license

-	Adding/Changing/Removing/Displaying/Sorting Data from files

-	Handling Errors


 
## Functions and Description
For changing and displaying names as well as dealing with files, I made some important key functions and other less complex functions to help my program with a total of 16 functions (No global variables were used)

The major functions are:
```
Option 1 : Adding data
-	The main goal of this function is to call for each function to write data in the file
-	Composed by calling many functions that are written in the beginning of the program such as getName (), getGender ()()â€¦ getBlood () to write the new data in the file
-	If an ID already exist, appropriate message is displayed.
```
```
Option 2 : Displaying data
-	The main goal of this function to display data in either (Sort by ID, Sort by Gender, Sort by First Name)
-	I created a menu which the user can select 
-	Errors of menu were handled (invalid inputs)
```
```
Option 3 : Editing data
The main reason behind this function is to adjust the data of a specific person (Editing, Removing) data or just show the data of that person
-	Reading the file line by line using loops and converting it to a list to see if a matched ID was found (by indexing) 
-	If a match was found, access the menu that consist of (Update,Remove,Leave)
-	If the user select update another menu pops up and it consist of what the user wants to change (Name,Phone Number.. etc)
-	If the user select for example Name, the program will go for the specific line that holds the matched Id and change the Name by the new data
-	If the user select remove, the line that holds that person data will be removed
-	Value Errors were handled
```
